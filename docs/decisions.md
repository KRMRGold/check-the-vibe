# Decisions

## M0 — Skeleton and secure shell

### Accepted implementation choices

- Use the plain JavaScript ESM architecture from build-spec.md; no UI framework or bundler.
- Use Electron Forge 8.0.1 and Electron 45.3.2 as the initial toolchain baseline.
- Use better-sqlite3 13.0.3 and Zod 4.6.7.
- Configure Playwright Test 1.65.0 for Electron E2E from M0.
- Add Playwright 1.65.0 as a direct dependency because its experimental Electron launcher is imported from the playwright package, not from the test-runner entry point.
- Configure the Forge auto-unpack-natives plugin because better-sqlite3 is a native Node module.
- Serve renderer files from a loopback HTTP server bound only to 127.0.0.1, using an OS-selected free port.
- Default CTV_PROVIDER_MODE to fixture so startup and tests do not make live provider requests.
- The only exposed preload method in M0 is ping; later IPC methods must be added explicitly and validated individually.

### Notes

- Electron Forge 8 requires Node.js 22.17.0 or newer; the reported local runtime is Node.js 24.15.0.
- The renderer Content Security Policy starts from build-spec.md §8.1. M1 must verify the exact policy and loopback hosting behavior with the YouTube IFrame API.
- Run npm install in the repository root to generate package-lock.json. Commit the generated lockfile before treating the dependency graph as reproducible.
- No test result is claimed by this commit. See TEST_RECORD.md.
